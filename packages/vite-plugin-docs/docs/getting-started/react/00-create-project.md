# Get Started with React

This quick guide will get you up and running with a Chrome Extension popup page.
You'll see how to integrate CRXJS with Vite, then explore Vite HMR in an
extension React HTML page. The first two sections take about 90 seconds!

<CreateProjectTabs projectType="react"/>

:::tip package.json

Check `package.json` to ensure that `"type": "module"` is set. If this package
key is missing, Vite might not be able to build `vite.config.js`. 

:::

## Install CRXJS

```sh
npm install --save-dev @crxjs/vite-plugin@beta
```

## Update the Vite config

Update `vite.config.js` to match the code below.

```js title=vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
// highlight-start
import { crx } from '@crxjs/vite-plugin'
import manifest from './manifest.json'
// highlight-end

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    // highlight-next-line
    crx({ manifest }),
  ],
})
```

Create a file named `manifest.json` next to `vite.config.js`.

```json title=manifest.json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "CRXJS React Vite Example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "action": { "default_popup": "index.html" }
}
```

## Note: make sure to update `tsconfig.node.json` file
When you update your `vite.config.ts` file then you should get an error called (down below)
```console
manifest.json is not listed within the file list of the project.
Projects must list all files or use an 'include' pattern.
```
Don't worry, you'll need to do a simple thing to solve this error.
- Open your `tsconfig.node.json` file from the project root directory.
- Then find the `include` property.
- Now update the array with this code. Besides, there is no need to change anything...
```json
{
  "include": ["vite.config.ts", "manifest.json"]
}
```
> Now the error is gone.ðŸ˜Š


## First development build

Time to run the dev command. ðŸ¤ž

```sh
npm run dev
```

That's it! CRXJS will do the rest.

Your project directory should look like this:

![RPCE File Structure](./assets/start-initial-files.png)

Next, we'll load the extension in the browser and give the development build a
test run.
